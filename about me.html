					From this day and so on, i don’t know how my life would be, or even you. We don’t know what path may <br>
					lead us but I dream for my future job to be a website designer because, I like to create and design <br>
					things and  that is my other passion. To give lively and unique creations of my very own ideas and sharing<br>
					it to others. Surpassing my limits is the greatest strength that I have also every should too. But there<br>
					is a time that I like to slack off because there are so many things to do even thinking of it makes me tired.<br>
					Even though I have many things on my plate I can still do it because I have determination.   <br>

				“When it comes to education and learning is closely related to several cognitive theories of motivation. <br>
				I believe that what goes on the classroom is my responsibility, and by working with students, all of us can create an ideal <br>
				environment for education, safety, understanding, and even fun. By keeping things positive, I believe that students will end up <br>
				learning more and getting more out of each and every lesson” <br>
